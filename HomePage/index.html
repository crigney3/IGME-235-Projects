        <h5>I am a 2nd Game Design and Development major who spends lots of his time on passion projects and hanging out with friends. I'm taking this class to improve my webdev skills and hopefully to be able to create browser games with Javascript. When I graduate, I'm hoping to work for a game development company, but I'm also happy to end up anywhere that does interesting software engineering projects.</h5>
